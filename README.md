# AWW1 - Analog Weather Watch for Pebble

This watch face used the Weather Underground API which isn't available anymore.

There is an update available that uses the Dark Sky API: [AWW1 - Analog Weather Watch](https://github.com/pbhgl/aww1/blob/master/pbw/aww1_1.16.pbw?raw=true)

The watch face can be sideloaded as described [here](https://www.guidingtech.com/sideload-apps-pebble-smartwatch/).
