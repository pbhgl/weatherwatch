# AWW1 - Analog Weather Watch for Pebble

This watch face used the Weather Underground API which isn't available anymore.

There is an update available that uses the Dark Sky API: [AWW1 - Analog Weather Watch](https://github.com/pbhgl/aww1/blob/master/pbw/aww1_1.16.pbw?raw=true)

The watch face can be sideloaded as described [here](https://www.guidingtech.com/sideload-apps-pebble-smartwatch/).

**Update March 25st, 2023**: The weather data from Dark Sky will no longer be available after March 31st, 2023.

There is now a [new AWW1 version on the Rebble appstore](https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/application/568ec32dfc66e37c3000006c) which uses the weather data from MET Norway.
